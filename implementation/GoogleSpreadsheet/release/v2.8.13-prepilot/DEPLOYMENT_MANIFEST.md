This package corrects the bounded-visibility defect in T1-01 acceptance
evidence. Before redacted/capped Diagnostic JSON, it exposes sorted unique
WARN/FAIL check IDs, completeness flags, closed counts, all-false read-only
side-effect Booleans, and Task/Ledger aggregate states. It never suppresses a
warning, infers an unobserved warning, or performs a repair.

This package corrects `PHASE8B-DASHBOARD-NUMBER-FORMAT-01` write visibility:
after the exact Dashboard control plane, seed/owned marker, and every
non-number-format surface are proven safe, Setup alone normalizes the exact
17×3 system block to the canonical plain-text number-format contract, calls
`SpreadsheetApp.flush()`, reacquires a fresh Range, and verifies the strict
postcondition. Config, Setup, and Dashboard independently bind the S90 module
contract and fail closed with `E_MODULE_VERSION_SKEW` when they differ. It is
a candidate for independent re-audit. It does not declare Phase 8B GO/PASS,
Phase 8C GO, production readiness, or pilot readiness. Real Google Workspace
validation remains `NOT EXECUTED` when this package is built locally.

## Authority and Setup control-plane contract

- A Task write uses a durable two-slot authority ledger: `PREPARED`, one Task
  row write, then `COMMITTED`.
- Recovery reads the protected hidden ledger. `authoritative_snapshot_json`, a
  cell note, live raw values, and post-edit values are never authority fallback
  sources.
- A missing, malformed, or conflicting authority record is quarantined or
  marked unrecoverable. It is excluded from Worker, Review, and Calendar paths.
- Task header rows 1 and 2 are canonical control-plane metadata and are
  restored by the common schema path.
- Migration 3 permits legacy note anchoring only at the explicit Schema 2.5
  migration boundary; it does not silently rebaseline a Schema 2.6 Task row.
- During `S20_CREATE_SCHEMAS`, Setup establishes the Ledger Sheet protection
  and hidden state before any authority validation. `S30` and a completed
  Setup rerun reassert those controls idempotently. A visibility/protection
  write failure leaves `S20_CREATE_SCHEMAS` incomplete and fails closed.
- The Dashboard safe pre-refresh state is only the exact Setup-owned
  sheet/header protection control plane plus exact three-row legacy seed.
  Foreign protections, values, formulas, notes, named ranges, merges, hidden
  state, malformed markers, duplicate keys, and unsafe formatting fail closed.
- A pre-S90 Setup resume may normalize number format only after that strict
  surface proof succeeds. The operation is idempotent, applies only to the
  exact 17×3 system block, flushes pending Spreadsheet writes, reacquires a
  fresh Range, and records bounded safe postcondition evidence. Every other
  Dashboard cell remains untouched. Quick and Deep Diagnostic remain read-only
  and continue to fail closed on a noncanonical number format.
- Config, Setup, and Dashboard contain independent identical S90 module
  contract literals. Setup proves their alignment before any Dashboard write;
  a mismatch fails closed with `E_MODULE_VERSION_SKEW`.
- Task checkbox checks derive from `validationPlanForSheet(Task)`, including
  `calendar_reconcile_required`. An identity-empty row may retain only a
  canonical schema-checkbox Boolean `false`; all other values/types fail.
- For a Sandbox with S00 through S80 recorded and S90/S99 incomplete, Setup
  resumes by revalidating controls and completing only S90 then S99. It must
  not duplicate or delete Gmail labels, the dedicated Calendar, Properties, or
  the owner edit trigger; Automation and the five-minute trigger remain OFF.
