This package corrects `PHASE8B-DASHBOARD-NUMBER-FORMAT-01`: after the exact
Dashboard control plane, seed/owned marker, and every non-number-format
surface are proven safe, Setup alone normalizes the exact 17×3 system block to
the canonical plain-text number-format contract. It is a candidate for
independent re-audit. It does not declare Phase 8B GO/PASS, Phase 8C GO,
production readiness, or pilot readiness. Real Google Workspace validation
remains `NOT EXECUTED` when this package is built locally.

## Authority and Setup control-plane contract

- A Task write uses a durable two-slot authority ledger: `PREPARED`, one Task
  row write, then `COMMITTED`.
- Recovery reads the protected hidden ledger. `authoritative_snapshot_json`, a
  cell note, live raw values, and post-edit values are never authority fallback
  sources.
- A missing, malformed, or conflicting authority record is quarantined or
  marked unrecoverable. It is excluded from Worker, Review, and Calendar paths.
- Task header rows 1 and 2 are canonical control-plane metadata and are
  restored by the common schema path.
- Migration 3 permits legacy note anchoring only at the explicit Schema 2.5
  migration boundary; it does not silently rebaseline a Schema 2.6 Task row.
- During `S20_CREATE_SCHEMAS`, Setup establishes the Ledger Sheet protection
  and hidden state before any authority validation. `S30` and a completed
  Setup rerun reassert those controls idempotently. A visibility/protection
  write failure leaves `S20_CREATE_SCHEMAS` incomplete and fails closed.
- The Dashboard safe pre-refresh state is only the exact Setup-owned
  sheet/header protection control plane plus exact three-row legacy seed.
  Foreign protections, values, formulas, notes, named ranges, merges, hidden
  state, malformed markers, duplicate keys, and unsafe formatting fail closed.
- A pre-S90 Setup resume may normalize number format only after that strict
  surface proof succeeds. The operation is idempotent, applies only to the
  exact 17×3 system block, and leaves every other Dashboard cell untouched.
  Quick and Deep Diagnostic remain read-only and continue to fail closed on a
  noncanonical number format.
- Task checkbox checks derive from `validationPlanForSheet(Task)`, including
  `calendar_reconcile_required`. An identity-empty row may retain only a
  canonical schema-checkbox Boolean `false`; all other values/types fail.
- For a Sandbox with S00 through S80 recorded and S90/S99 incomplete, Setup
  resumes by revalidating controls and completing only S90 then S99. It must
  not duplicate or delete Gmail labels, the dedicated Calendar, Properties, or
  the owner edit trigger; Automation and the five-minute trigger remain OFF.
